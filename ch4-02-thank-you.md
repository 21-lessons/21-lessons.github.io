I am currently working on a second, more ambitious project: [21 Ways][21ways].
You can [support me on Patreon][patreon] to get an exclusive glimpse and early
access to current drafts, artwork, and other things. You can also [support me
directly][support] via bitcoin.

Your support allows me to allocate more time to
writing and creating free, open-source education. It's what I love to do. I hope
that I will be able to dedicate all my time to it one day. To all of you who
support me already: thank you. From the bottom of my heart.

Thank you. 🙏🧡
