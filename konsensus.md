Dear Amazon,

I am the author of [21 Lessons](https://21lessons.com/), a book published under
a [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license. The
[English version](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1697526349/) of the book was
approved by you and is available on Amazon. The [Kindle
version](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083L93MJ7) was approved by you as well and
is available on Amazon too.

The book was [translated into multiple
languages](https://21lessons.com/translations) by volunteers under the same CC
BY-SA 4.0 license. The [German version](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B085KR54YT/)
"21 Lektionen" was approved by you and is available on Amazon.

[Niko Laamanen](https://twitter.com/OmniFinn) did the Dutch translation and he
would like to publish it via Amazon. This is explicitly allowed by the
license, so he doesn't even need my permission, which he has anyway.

However, it seems like you think that he did something wrong, which is probably
why you banned him and shut down his account. This is terribly wrong and quite
concerning.

So, again, just for you guys:

**I hereby grant [Konsensus
Network](https://konsensus.network/) all necessary rights to publish 21 Lessons
in other languages, such as Dutch and Finnish. These rights are implicit in the Creative
Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) license.**

I know I repeat myself, but once more for good measure: I have chosen the CC
BY-SA 4.0 license so that I don't have to write letters like this. Everyone is
free to remix my content and sell it for profit under this copyleft license.

I hope you rectify this situation swiftly.

Sincerely, \\
[Gigi](https://dergigi.com/contact) (the author of the book in question)
